title: The Trouble With...

excerpt: More purple thinking - the philosophy that lets us make truly remarkable products.
---
Many years ago, a young programmer read John Wyndham's *Trouble With Lichen* and it was the title as much as the story that stuck with him. That title has become a strand of Purple Thinking and today we apply the 'trouble with...' preface to a lot of things as the starting point for understanding what problems exist in our world and how we can address them.

By way of explanation I shall give you an example:

A friend recently returned from a tech show, full of the desire to create a paradigm-shifting, consciousness-altering, society-reforming something-or-other. That was where his problem began; he was frustrated because he did not know what the something-or-other could be. He wanted to participate but he did not know how. Listening to his gushing enthusiasm for Twitter and Flikr, and Facebook and blah, it was clear that he was starting from the wrong point â€“ more beige thinking.

Instead of dwelling on what is good about yesterday's inventions that are now commonplace, we should ask 'what's the trouble with...?'. It is by solving problems that most people do not even recognise that we improve our world and the lives of others. It is in an environment where one makes small, incremental improvements to things that most people consider okay, that invention flourishes.

I pointed this out to my friend and as a user of much of the technology he was so enthusiastically evangelising it has been heartening since then to see the change in him. Once he started thinking in purple and asked what the trouble with x, y or z might be, he started producing more ideas for smart 'inventions' than could be developed in ten years!

At Countersoft, we come up with great ideas for our products because we constantly critique the fruit of our labours. No sooner has one version gone out the door than we begin garnering feedback from our users and brainstorming ideas. Our mantra is: "We are sorry, but the trouble with the version we just gave you is...You deserve better and we are working very hard to address this situation for you.""

We release at least two versions of our products every year because that reflects the rate at which we challenge what is in them. We have no editions because we believe that our customers deserve the best that we can give them. To improve we need participation, but why should anyone participate with a supplier who hides features of their product from them?

We need a user community that says to us 'thanks, but the trouble with this, that or t'other is...' It might be flattering to be on the Platinum (oooh look at the big boys) edition, but you are by definition part of a small community and the history of human achievement is the history of collaboration. It cannot possibly be to *_your_* benefit to be part of a reduced user group.

Join us, think in purple today. If you want to do something interesting, think of something you rely on and like, then think to yourself 'yes, but the trouble with it is...'. You might be surprised by what you come up with. Whatever it is, we are sure it will be an improvement.
