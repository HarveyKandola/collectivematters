You spend all that money on [issue tracking or project management software](http://www.geminiplatform.com) and yet it fails miserably at some point after deployment. If your issue tracker of choice is not set up correctly people will just stop using it, move to other systems, or even resort to email.

So here are the top mistakes that we see time and time again.

### 1. Not Understanding Projects and Users

> Are we managing both "Support" and "Development" projects?

> Will we allow our customers access?

Not taking the time to select which project types will be managed will lead to issues, tickets, bugs, change requests being pushed into places where they don't belong. Nothing worse than having support tickets dumped into Development projects, right?

Excluding users or not thinking through who else needs participate won't help your workflow and will probably result in other systems being introduced. It's never good having two tracking systems to manage projects.

What you need to do:

* List projects (current and future) that can be included
* List user groups that might require project participation (e.g. Testers, Developers, Clients)
* Map out logical project groupings and link them to user groups

### 2. Not Knowing Which Process To Manage

> Which internal business processes (e.g. Change Request, Defect) are we managing with the issue tracker?

> Which external-facing business processes (e.g. Support Ticket, Investigation) are we managing with the issue tracker?

Without a clear list of processes to be managed, confusion and frustration will rise because people might not realize which items should be pushed into the issue tracker. People then gradually stop logging items leading to a declining user base.

What you need to do:

* List internal and external processes to be managed
* Identify projects to be managed
* Map business processes to projects

### 3. Not Asking The Right Questions

> What data fields does the user fill in when logging Defects and when raising Change Requests?

> Which custom data fields need to be added to the platform (e.g. "Client Name", "Internal Build Number")? Is too much information presented on screen during issue logging?

Asking for too much or too little information when logging new issues can prevent users from actually using the system or becoming frustrated by irrelevant input prompts.

The wrong questions being asked will also alienate users from your issue tracker â€“ only ask relevant questions when you are looking to collect data for a specific process.

What you need to do:

* Determine which data fields are required per process
* Identify mandatory data fields and any required custom fields
* Consider the difference between data entry when creating and editing an item

### 4. Not Considering External Participants

> Which external entities need access to the platform to view, update and close tasks?

> Do we have external team members who work on project deliverables?

> What data visibility considerations do we need to consider across organizations?

Without understanding how external users might impact data within your issue tracker, you might put in place project structures, permissions and a working culture that will require overhaul if and when you decide to allow external project participants.

When internal users are not aware of external participants, the lack of appreciation of sensitive information can lead to problems.

What you need to do:

* Determine what access external participants require
* Determine whether external participants require help desk or project team member status
* Publish guidelines on when internal users should leverage Issue and Comment visibility to suppress information from external users

### 5. Not Being Agile

Mapping out every single possible usage scenario, supporting edge cases, tuning for the perfect state is a sure fire way of killing off your issue tracker before it even gets off the ground.

Building convoluted workflows that seem to cover every angle will just make things less transparent to the average user.

Being agile means starting small and heading in the right direction with gradual adjustments (and not thinking up every scenario from day one).

What you need to do:

* Analyze less, use more
* Take the Agile approach and iterate you way to a better issue tracker deployment

End result? An optimized issue management platform that does not get in the way of doing your day job.
