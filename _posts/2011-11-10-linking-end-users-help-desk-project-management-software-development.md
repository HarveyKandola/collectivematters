title: Lesson in Linking End Users, Help Desk, Project Management and Software Development
tags: best-practice
excerpt: So how can you can get end users, help desk, project management and software development teams working seamlessly?

Picture this scene:

* You are an international organization that has a presence in most countries worldwide.
* You produce goods in factories that are sold to consumers through the retail channel.
* You leverage internally maintained ERP software and other line-of-business applications to keep operations running.
* You are always growing the business by company acquisitions and each new entity you bring in needs to migrate over to existing ERP and other technology platforms.
* Employees around the world expect formal IT support, project management for the ERP and other software deployed.

It's pretty clear to state that software development, project management and help desk capabilities are at the front lines of such an organization. They are centralized but serve all divisions around the globe.

When you have centralized IT powering the organization through internally developed and maintained systems, there really is no place to hide and no room for mistakes. IT is critical and the teams within IT are held to account every day.

IT handle and respond to Bug Reports, Change Requests, New Feature Requests, Investigations, System Access Requests, and so on.

It's a large, watchful IT operation that is generally typical of any blue chip who utilizes IT to deliver business benefit.

### The Help Desk Challenge

Centralized help desk support the different business units based around the world. End users in such countries make use of the central help desk when reporting problems, requesting enhancements and help using the deployed IT.

Here is a typical flow:

1. Assess and prioritize support tickets from users around the world who expect a certain level of service.
2. Liaise with business, process and IT specialists to validate each and every request to ensure ticket outcomes are consistent with IT, legal, and corporate guidelines and strategy.
3. Liaise with software development team to understand technical implications and possible solutions.
4. Coordinate with project management to ascertain development and delivery schedules.

### The Project Management Challenge

Project Management teams handle IT roll-outs at new locations around the globe.

But as soon as you complete the current IT refresh cycle the next cycle of IT software updates are almost ready to be rolled out. It's a never ending cycle of change that drives the business forward in terms of capability, operational efficiency and manufacturing optimization.

Every location demands that they receive a different flavor of ERP systems because they have special requirements like no other. But the Project Management mandate states that IT systems must be centralized to the maximum and deviations will only permitted under the strictest of corporate guidelines.

Post go-live all support then is shifted from in-the-field Project Management to the centralized support desk.

### End Users (of IT Applications)

Users just want things to function to make things easier and to keep the business ticking over when targets and metrics have to met and reported back to HQ.

Small local, first-line support teams are in the trenches and face-off with business people inside factories, sales, finance and marketing operations. IT should be silent and work without glitches - and when they request changes or report problems they expect service every day of the week.

### The Software Development Sandwich

In between Project Management and the Support Desk sit the organizations centralized software development team.

Continuous software application improvements are the order of the day whilst trying to build and maintain software that is all things to all men. No software team wants to support multiple variants of the same core application - it's a Developer and Tester nightmare.

### ...And The Humble (Unifying) Issue Tracker

The challenge was to get different teams, in different locations, with different objectives working from a single platform in terms of tracking support requests, change management whilst ensuring effective communication coupled with understandable and transparent workflow.

A week long workshop was instigated where a single representative from each stakeholder group (users, project management, support desk, development) attended and thrashed out the initial implementation of unified project and support platform based on an issue tracker. Face to face, truly agile in every sense of word with phone calls and emails to wider team members asking for immediate unconditional feedback as initial decisions were taken during the workshop.

It was understood from day one that EVERYONE involved would have to give and take. Nobody gets their way 100% of the time and everyone has to compromise for the greater good of the organization. Senior Managers were told to "butt out" and let their staff make the decisions as they are the closest to the action. People are paid to do a job and usually respond better when you give them a chance to perform. That was the case.

During that workshop week the following was achieved:

* All processes that would be managed by the issue tracker were identified and minimized in terms of their footprint.
* Data entry and viewing screens were established per process and varied to factor in permissions and process stage.
* Workflow per process was defined ensuring at all times that "Janet" sitting in the corner could understand how things generally flowed.
* Initial projects were created catering for both support desk and project implementation teams.
* Users and their permissions were identified and set up so as to minimize on-going maintenance.

All this was achieved by the end of Day Four. Remarkable given we started from scratch Monday morning and worked regular 9-to-6 hours. Immense synergy within the small workshop team.

End result? One issue tracker deployed to a single web server and accessible by all who needed it through the browser of their choice (OK, IE6 was killed off!).

On Day Five it was time to kick the tires:

* Simulation testing using real user accounts that represented each stakeholder group.
* The Change Request process was first simulated using a routine request-and-response with no dramas.
* Next up a more challenging Change Request process was simulated where review-reject-revisit-approve cycle tested communication and workflow steps.
* Then a Change Request "from hell" process was tested where multiple "sub-tasks" were spun off affecting multiple business units, geographies, with a "failed" go-live deployment thrown in for good measure.

Suffice to say refinements occurred during the simulations but everyone felt very happy knowing full well that we had a solid starting place.

Don't expect everything to be perfect from Day One, edge cases will crop up, and we are all expected to tolerate and refine as we go along. That was the key message that was pushed home at every opportunity to all concerned (and everyone got it).

It can be done because it has been done. Here are the key ingredients to make it happen for you as well:

* Involvement of operational experience experts from different disciplines.
* Willingness to compromise when required.
* Agile approach from all stakeholder groups before, during and after.
* One workshop leader who has been in the trenches within Support, Development and Project Management disciplines.
* And a versatile issue management platform.

Proof that we can accomplish anything if we work together.
